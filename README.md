Laraship Laravel Marketplace is a Laravel Multi-vendor e-commerce platform, which enables sellers to promote their products under a single hub.

With Laraship Laravel Marketplace you can specify your business model of vendor enrollment, either by subscribing to a recurring plan, or even directly with no recurring fees.
During the buyer checkout process,  products at the cart will be grouped on vendor level and an order will be created per store, the payment will go to the site owner, and a commision percentage can be defined and be deducted from that vendor money.

Laraship Laravel Marketplace is your best choice to build a mult vendor ecommerce with multiple online stores at one place.
